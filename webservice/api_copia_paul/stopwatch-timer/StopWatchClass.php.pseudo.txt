	Useful in determining time to complete various tasks inside a php script.
	Keeps track of time intervals in either milliseconds (by default) or microseconds from the Start to the Stop
	with an unlimited number of intermediate, named intervals.
	Start, stop, and interval entries may be given optional unique names.
	When a start, stop, or interval name is not given, the class assigns a name beginning with ~.
	To run the stop watch you need, as a minimum, to create the object and then call the Stop function.
	You can create intervals anywhere the stopwatch object is visible in your script.
	Individual intervals can be retrieved by name.
	The array of intervals can be retrieved at any time.
	Stop automatically returns the entire interval array.
	The increments between intervals are saved in a name-value-pair (NvP) array
	and are not deleted when the timer stops, so intervals and the entire array can be retrieved
	after the timer is stopped and before another start is issued.
	You need to have the following in your script.
	include_once [path.] "StopWatchClass.php";
	$watch = new stopwatch();
